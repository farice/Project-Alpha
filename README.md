Open Source EEG Software for Neuroscientists

## Shiny Suite

The app.R and server.R files can be compiled on a Shiny Server to provide a functional interface for EEG and Cognitive data analysis.

One can visualize regressors in a scatter plot matrix, perform logistic regressions, and reactively adjust parameters.

Features are automatically extracted from data that is uploaded with the defined structure.
